# Agile Methodology Simplified

A group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. 
Agile is a project management approach that divides projects into smaller, manageable parts called sprints. After each sprint, the team reviews their progress and makes improvements for the next phase. Agile is an iterative process, meaning it continuously evolves based on feedback and reflection.


## The Four Core Values of Agile

The Agile Manifesto, created by 17 software developers in 2001, outlines four key values that guide Agile development:

1. **Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools**: Agile prioritizes collaboration and teamwork over strict adherence to processes and tools. The focus is on people working together effectively.

2. **Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation**: Agile teams aim to deliver functional software that works well. While documentation is important, it takes a back seat to delivering high-quality, working products.

3. **Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation**: Agile places a strong emphasis on working closely with customers to understand their needs and make adjustments as necessary. The goal is to build a product that truly meets customer expectations.

4. **Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**: Agile embraces change and flexibility, allowing teams to adjust their strategies as new information or requirements emerge, rather than sticking rigidly to a predefined plan.

## The 12 Agile Principles

Building on these values, Agile is guided by 12 principles that help teams work more effectively:

1. **Customer Satisfaction Through Early and Continuous Delivery**: Delivering valuable updates frequently keeps customers engaged and satisfied.

2. **Welcome Changing Requirements, Even Late in Development**: Agile is designed to adapt to changes at any stage of the project, ensuring the final product meets current needs.

3. **Deliver Working Software Frequently**: Regularly delivering updates and new features keeps the development process dynamic and responsive.

4. **Encourage Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Breaking down silos and fostering collaboration among all team members is key to success in Agile.

5. **Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals**: Teams perform best when members are motivated and empowered to take ownership of their work.

6. **Prioritize Face-to-Face Communication**: Direct communication, whether in person or via video calls, is the most effective way to share ideas and solve problems.

7. **Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress**: The ultimate goal is to deliver a functional product, and progress is measured by working software.

8. **Maintain a Sustainable Pace of Work**: Agile teams should work at a steady pace to avoid burnout and maintain long-term productivity.

9. **Focus on Technical Excellence and Good Design**: High-quality work and thoughtful design improve agility and speed in future iterations.

10. **Simplicity is Essential**: The simplest solution is often the most effective, reducing complexity and increasing clarity.

11. **Self-Organizing Teams are Most Effective**: Teams that are empowered to make decisions and manage their own work tend to deliver the most value.

12. **Regular Reflection and Adaptation**: Teams should regularly review their work and processes to identify areas for improvement and make adjustments as needed.

## Popular Agile Methodologies

Agile is an overarching framework that includes several specific methodologies. One of the most widely used is:

### Kanban

This method uses a visual board to track tasks through different stages of development, such as 'To Do,' 'In Progress,' and 'Done.' Tasks are represented by cards that move across the board as work progresses. Kanban helps teams visualize their workflow, manage tasks more effectively, and quickly identify any bottlenecks or delays.

By following these values and principles, Agile teams can work more flexibly, respond to change faster, and deliver high-quality products that meet customer needs.
